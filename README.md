# Bookstore
Program designed to work with MySQL database, and simulate bookstore operation.
The database stores information about:
- customers
- authors
- books
- publishers

On each step of the simulation a random number of books are being sold to the customers.
If a book is not in stock, store will reach the publisher to buy new books while the customer order is awaiting completion.
After each step all orders to the publisher or store are recorded in the table and total data about sales is displayed.
